# meklu's IFP2018 answers

This repo contains my answers to the exercises of the University of Helsinki's
Introduction to Functional Programming course of Spring 2018.

All answers for each of the seven weeks of the course can be found in the
appropriately named `.hs` files.

Please keep in mind that these answers are by no means officially sanctioned.

P.S. It might not look pretty all throughout but at least it's functional. ;)
